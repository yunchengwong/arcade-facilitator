    "Cymbal Direct, the retail arm of Cymbal, wants to leverage the power of Gemini 2.0 Flash to gain a competitive edge in the basketball sneaker market. They aim to analyze competitor pricing, understand customer preferences, and generate synthetic data for testing new ecommerce features. You, as a data analyst, are tasked with using Gemini's capabilities to help Cymbal Direct achieve these goals. This will involve:\n",
    "  * **Code Execution**: Demonstrate the ability to execute Python code within Gemini 2.0 Flash\n",
    "  * **Grounding**: Use grounding to enhance the accuracy and relevance of Gemini's responses to questions about retail products.\n",
    "  * **Controlled Generation**: Retrieve information about basketball sneakers and their pricing from competitors using Google Search.\n",
    "  * **Synthetic Data Generation**: Structure the extracted product and pricing information into a predefined JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide Cymbal Direct with actionable insights to refine their marketing strategy, improve their products, and bolster product positioning. Are you ready for the challenge?"
