## Introduction to gen AI foundations

1. **Which of the following is NOT a key feature of foundation models?**

- Flexible to support various use cases.
- Adaptable to new domains and tasks.
- Specialized to specific tasks. ✔️
- Trained on diverse data.

2. **Which of the following best defines a foundation model?**

- Traditional machine learning algorithms that rely on explicitly defined rules.
- Small, very specialized AI models trained on narrow datasets in order to perform specific tasks.
- Large AI models trained on a vast quantity of data, capable of adapting to a variety of tasks. ✔️
- Hardware infrastructure used to train and deploy AI models.

3. **How do foundation models and prompt engineering work together to create value in generative AI?**

- Foundation models ensure the ethical use of generative AI, while prompt engineering focuses on improving the quality and creativity of outputs.
- Prompt engineering trains foundation models on specific tasks, allowing them to generate highly specialized content and insights.
- Foundation models offer a vast knowledge base, and prompt engineering guides the model to use this knowledge in responses. ✔️
- Foundation models provide the computing power for generative AI, while prompt engineering directs that power to complete specific tasks.

4. **What is the purpose of a prompt in the context of foundation models?**

- To provide input to the model and trigger an output. ✔️
- To evaluate the model's performance.
- To fine-tune the model for a specific task.
- To train the model on new data.

5. **What is the primary difference between foundation models and traditional AI models?**

- Foundation models are trained on specific data for a single task, while traditional models are trained on diverse data for various tasks.
- Foundation models are only trained on text data, while traditional models use images and code.
- Foundation models are trained on massive amounts of diverse data for various tasks, while traditional models are trained on specific data for a single task. ✔️
- Foundation models cannot be adapted to new tasks, while traditional models can.

## Gen AI strategy

1. **Why is it important for mid-level managers and individual contributors to be involved in gen AI adoption?**

- They should avoid any involvement in gen AI experimentation.
- Their focus should be solely on technical implementation details.
- They have limited understanding of daily operations and user needs.
- Their proximity to workflows allows them to identify impactful gen AI solutions. ✔️

2. **What is the recommended approach for businesses to effectively implement gen AI?**

- Focus on a top-down strategy driven by executives.
- Adopt the latest gen AI trends.
- Focus on a bottom-up approach with no overarching plan.
- Combine a top-down strategic vision with bottom-up input from teams. ✔️

3. **What is a key advantage of using Google Cloud's gen AI ecosystem for businesses?**

- It eliminates the need for companies to cultivate internal gen AI knowledge and experimentation across their organizations.
- It allows businesses to leverage Google's AI advancements without starting from scratch. ✔️
- It forces each and every business to become an "AI-first" company.
- It assures businesses that they will achieve immediate and widespread success in all of their generative AI endeavors.

4. **Which of the following is a benefit of using Google Cloud for gen AI development?**

- It provides comprehensive services, including scalable infrastructure, enterprise-grade governance and security. ✔️
- It focuses primarily on individual developer tools without robust governance or scalability features.
- It requires extensive upfront hardware investments for running complex AI workloads.
- It offers a limited set of pre-trained AI models for specific industry use cases.
