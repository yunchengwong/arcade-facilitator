5. **How do data analytics and business intelligence differ from AI and ML?**

- Data analytics and business intelligence use automated decision-making processes, whereas AI and ML require human intervention and interpretation of data.
- Data analytics and business intelligence are used only in small businesses, whereas AI and ML are used exclusively by large corporations.
- Data analytics and business intelligence identify trends from historical data, whereas AI and ML use data to make decisions for future business. ✔️
- Data analytics and business intelligence involve advanced algorithms for predicting future trends, whereas AI and ML focus on processing historical data.

6. **What does the consistency dimension refer to when data quality is being measured?**

- Whether a dataset is free from duplicate values that could prevent an ML model from learning accurately.
- Whether all the required information is present.
- Whether the data is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the phenomenon that is being modeled.
- Whether the data is uniform and doesn’t contain any contradictory information. ✔️

7. **Which dimension for measuring data quality means that the data conforms to a set of predefined standards and definitions such as type and format?**

- Accuracy
- Uniqueness
- Validity ✔️
- Consistency

8. **You’re watching a video on YouTube and are shown a list of videos that YouTube thinks you are interested in. What ML solution powers this feature?**

- Content moderation
- Personalized recommendations ✔️
- Clickbait detection
- Video transcription

9. **Google applies generative AI to products like Google Workspace, but what is generative AI?**

- A type of artificial intelligence that can create and sustain its own consciousness.
- A type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data. ✔️
- A type of artificial intelligence that can understand and respond to human emotions.
- A type of artificial intelligence that can make decisions and take actions.

10. **Which technology relies on models to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make predictions and informed decisions?**

- Expert systems
- Machine learning ✔️
- Robotics
- Natural language processing
