5. **Why is escalating a support ticket not always the best course of action when trying to resolve an issue?**

- It can result in increased power consumption, impacting carbon neutrality.
- It may disrupt the workflow of the Customer Care team and lead to delays in other cases. ✔️
- It may reduce the number of available virtual machines.
- It can increase the monthly cost of support plans.

6. **Which of these measures should be automated on a regular basis and stored in geographically separate locations to allow for rapid recovery from disasters or failures?**

- Inventory data
- Backups ✔️
- Log files
- Security patches

7. **What does the Cloud Profiler tool do?**

- It collects and stores all application and infrastructure logs.
